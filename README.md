# Underground-VR_MSc

This is a small concept project used to explore audio and visual components within the Unity Engine. The VR experience is based in a small underground tunnel with a handful of added interactions that are both audible and visual.

## Features:

### :flashlight: Functional Flashlight
The user is able to use the left VR controller to pick up the flashlight which spawns on the rail line. With the flashlight in hand, pressing the trigger will toggle the Realtime light cast, enable a bulb texture and play a foley sound.

### :construction_worker: Animated NPC Characters
In the tunnel the user can find 2 animated characters. Firstly, there is an older character who is rolling around in pain on the right-hand side of the rail track. As well as this there is an animated construction worker who is leaning against the tunnel walls, he has an idle animation, but his head will turn to face the player each time the player changes position.

### :sound: Directional Sounds & Visual Effects
Throughout the scene there is a plethora of directional sounds: Character pain sounds attached to the NPC, flashlight foley sound on the toggle of the flashlight and  gas leak sound. As well as this there is an ambient tunnel sound in the background that loops. For visual effects there are a handful of sparks on the electrical wires on the tunnel sides, as well as a visual gas leak towards the end of the tunnel.
